This is a Rocketseat challenge. I found it interesting because I was curious about how to make the progress bar. I’ve completed the challenge, but it still has some bugs to fix, since it won't work well on other browsers plus firefox because I’ve tried to make it using input type="range". You can see the reason in this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sliding-nightmare-understanding-range-input/" target="_blank">article</a>.
